# Day 1 Notes - Git Fundamentals

## What I Learned

**Git is a version control system:**
- Tracks every change to my code
- Acts like a time machine
- Backs up to GitHub

**Three states:**
1. Working Directory (where I edit)
2. Staging Area (git add)
3. Repository (git commit)

**Key commands:**
- `git status` - Check what changed
- `git add` - Stage changes
- `git commit -m "message"` - Save snapshot
- `git push` - Upload to GitHub
- `git log` - View history

## Why This Matters

Without Git, I'd have 50 versions of files and confusion.
With Git, one file, infinite history, perfect tracking.

In Month 6, when I'm working on blockchain projects, 
Git will save me when I break something.

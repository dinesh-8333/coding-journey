# Day 2 - Git Branching Practice

## What I Learned

**Branches allow parallel development:**
- Main branch stays stable
- Feature branches for experiments
- Safe to try new things

## Commands Learned

- `git branch` - List branches
- `git branch name` - Create branch
- `git checkout name` - Switch to branch
- `git switch name` - Modern way to switch

## Why This Matters

When building projects, I can:
- Work on new features safely
- Keep working code intact
- Experiment without fear

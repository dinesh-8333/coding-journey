# Why I'm Doing This

**Date:** October 3, 2025

## Current Situation

I'm a CA. I work with Excel and manual processes daily. I see their limitations.

## My Why

**1. Build, don't just use**  
I want to create tools, not just use them.

**2. Finance + Tech = Rare**  
Most finance people can't code. Most coders don't understand finance. I'll be both.

**3. Automate Everything**  
Every boring task can be automated with code.

**4. Future-Proof Career**  
AI, blockchain, automation are the future of finance.

**5. Freedom**  
Remote work. Location independence. Build products that scale.

## When I Want to Quit

**I'll remember:**
- Every expert was once a beginner
- Hard days are part of learning
- I've come too far to stop
- Future me will thank present me

---

## My Commitment

2 hours/day, Monday-Friday, for 18 months.

Show up daily. No excuses.

When motivation fails, discipline continues.
